Incident Response Plan: Accidental Key File Deletion

1. Immediate Actions:

Identify the deleted file:
Determine the exact filename, location, and timestamp of deletion through system logs or user reports.

Verify the deletion:
Use file system utilities like ls -l or dir to confirm the file's absence and ensure it wasn't moved elsewhere.

Check backups:
Prioritize recovering the file from recent backups. If backups are readily available and recent, restore the file and verify functionality.
If backups are unavailable or outdated, proceed to the next step.

2. Data Recovery Attempt:

Utilize data recovery tools:
Run specialized data recovery software on the server to scan for recently deleted files. This might require temporarily taking the system offline.
If successful, restore the file and verify its integrity using checksums or comparison with a known good copy.

3. Escalation and Alternative Solutions:

If data recovery fails:
Alert relevant teams (security, operations) and escalate the incident for further investigation and potential alternative solutions.

Depending on the severity and impact of the missing credentials, consider:
Regenerating credentials: If possible, securely regenerate the access key and update configurations accordingly. This might involve contacting the service provider for assistance.

Resetting access: If key regeneration is not feasible, initiate a secure process to reset access to the affected service(s) following established procedures.

4. Secure the System (Throughout the process):

Isolate the affected system:
Minimize access and potential exploitation risks while the recovery process is ongoing.

Change compromised passwords:
If there's a possibility of unauthorized access due to the deleted key, promptly change passwords or rotate access tokens associated with the compromised credentials.

Monitor for suspicious activity:
Increase security monitoring and logging to detect any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activity related to the deleted key.

5. Post-incident Review and Prevention Plan:

Document the incident:
Detail the events, actions taken, and lessons learned.

Review backup procedures:
Ensure regular, automated backups are in place for critical files and systems. Consider implementing version control or snapshotting mechanisms for crucial configuration files.

Implement user training:
Educate users on the importance of data sensitivity and potential consequences of accidental deletions.
Encourage users to double-check and confirm actions before deleting files, especially those in critical locations.

Explore permission control:
Evaluate the necessity of granting full delete permissions to users. Consider restricting access or implementing additional confirmation steps for deleting sensitive files.
This plan prioritizes rapid recovery while minimizing risks and implementing preventive measures for the future. Remember, the specific actions and solutions might vary depending on the situation and the affected service's securityÂ requirements.
