Incident Response Plan: Payment Gateway Outage
1. Initial Response (15:00 - 15:30 UTC)

Assemble the incident response team: This includes me as a SRE, developers, and other relevant personnel.

Confirm the incident:
Verify the reported symptoms using New Relic for error rates and CloudWatch for connectivity.
Analyze Splunk logs for any error messages or unusual activity.

Isolate the issue:
Check if the outage is affecting all components (frontend, backend, payment gateway) or specific parts.
Utilize Kubernetes health checks to identify failing pods in the payment gateway service.


2. Investigation and Diagnosis (15:30 - 16:00 UTC)

Gather additional information:
Review recent code deployments or configuration changes.
Check AWS Health dashboard for any reported issues with RDS or other services.
Investigate resource utilization metrics on Kubernetes and AWS to identify potential bottlenecks.

Probable Root Cause Analysis:

High error rates:
Code bug in the payment gateway service
Issue with the connection to the backend database
High load causing system overload
Complete loss of connectivity:
Kubernetes cluster failure
Network connectivity issues between components
Outtage with the payment gateway provider


3. Recovery and Resolution (16:00 - 17:00 UTC)

Proposed Solutions:
For high error rates:
If a code bug is identified, deploy a hotfix or rollback to the previous version.
Investigate and address any database connection issues.
If resource overload is suspected, scale up the payment gateway service in Kubernetes.
For complete loss of connectivity:
If a Kubernetes cluster issue, attempt to restart affected pods or scale the service down and up to trigger a self-healing mechanism.
Work with the network team to troubleshoot any connectivity problems.
If a payment gateway provider outage, consider offering alternative payment methods (if available) and communicate the situation transparently to customers.

Monitor the recovery process:
Closely monitor error rates and system health after implementing solutions.
If the issue persists, further investigation and collaboration with relevant teams might be necessary.


4. Post-Incident Review (17:00 onwards)

Document the incident:
Include the timeline, symptoms, response actions, root cause analysis, and resolution steps.

Identify improvement opportunities:
Evaluate the effectiveness of the incident response plan.
Discuss potential preventative measures to avoid similar incidents in the future, such as:
1.Implementing automated alerts for exceeding error rate thresholds.
2.Conducting regular load testing and vulnerability assessments.
3.Establishing a process for code reviews and change management.
4.Having a disaster recovery plan in place for criticalÂ services.
